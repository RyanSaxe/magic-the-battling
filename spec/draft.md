# Draft Page Specification

In Magic: the Battling, players alternate between drafting, building, and battling with hands of cards they craft. The page where players spend most of their time is the Draft Page. This document outlines the specifications for the Draft Page, including its layout, functionality, and user interactions.

## Sideboard

The sideboard should be organized in the center of the screen, with cards displayed in a grid format with 4 columns.

## Hand

The hand should be organized in a horizontal row in the top center of the screen. Hand size changes over the course of the game. it starts at 3 cards, and can increase up to 7 cards.

## Pack

In the bottom center of the screen, there should be an area that shows the player's current pack of cards. The pack should be organized in a horizontal row with 5 cards.

## Cards

Whenever any non-upgrade card is clicked (i.e. cards in the pool, hand, or pack), a button that says "swap" should appear on all the other non-upgrade cards. When the player clicks the "swap" button on another card, the two cards should swap places. If the player clicks anywhere else on the screen, all "swap" buttons should disappear.

## Upgrades

Above the treasures, there should be an area that shows the player's current upgrades (conspiracy cards). They should be on the left of the screen in a vertical row. Each upgrade should have a button that says "apply". When the player clicks this button, they should be allowed to select one card from their pool to apply the upgrade to. Once that card is selected, the button should no longer exists, as upgrades can only be applied once.

## Treasures

In the bottom left of the screen, next to the "pack", there should be an area that shows a treasure token, and the number of treasure tokens that player has. If the player has 1 or more tokens, there should be a button titled "roll". When the player clicks this button, the cards in their pack should be replaced with 5 new random cards from the central Battler.

## Player Info

At the right of the screen, a player should be able to see the following information about all players (including themselves):

1. Player Name
2. Player Avatar
3. Player Poison

The order of players should be in increasing order of poison (lowest poison at the top). If two players have the same poison, they should be ordered alphabetically by name.

Then, if the player clicks on a player, an area at the bottom right should show the following information about that player: the player's revealed cards in their most recent battle
