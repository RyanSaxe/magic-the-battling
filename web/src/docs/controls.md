## Overview

The game UI is split into a few areas. The bottom-left holds an **actions menu** with context-sensitive actions for the current phase and selected cards. The bottom-right has **navigation controls** for advancing through phases and submitting results.

Each phase has its own set of controls and hotkeys:

- [Draft Phase controls](doc:draft#controls) — picking cards and rerolling packs
- [Build Phase controls](doc:build#controls) — constructing your hand and applying upgrades
- [Battle Phase controls](doc:battle#controls) — drag-and-drop and game-actions
- [Reward Phase controls](doc:reward#controls) — claiming your rewards
