## Finals

When only two players remain, the game enters the **finals**. Finals follow the same draft → build → battle → reward cycle, but with one key change to who gets to choose to play or draw:

- In the **first game** of the finals, the player with the most [poison](doc:game-pieces#poison) chooses play or draw (same as normal rounds).
- In **subsequent games**, the **loser** of the previous game gets to choose.
- If the previous game was a **draw**, the choice falls back to whoever has the most [poison](doc:game-pieces#poison).

## Sudden Death

In order for the game to be as fun as possible, there should always be a final match. Because of this, at any time multiple players are eliminated in the same phase, and that would cause 1 or less players left alive, the two eliminated players with the least poison are set to 9 poison and face off in Sudden Death.

Sudden Death is a loop between the [build](doc:build) and [battle](doc:battle) phases until one player is eliminated. Basically, the players will play against eachother until one is eliminated, but without any rewards or chance to draft new cards.
