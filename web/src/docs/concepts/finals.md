## Overview

When only two players remain, the game enters the **finals**. Finals follow the same draft → build → battle → reward cycle, but with one key change to the coin flip rule.

## Coin Flip

- In the **first game** of the finals, the player with the most [poison](doc:poison) chooses play or draw (same as normal rounds).
- In **subsequent games**, the **loser** of the previous game gets to choose.
- If the previous game was a **draw**, the choice falls back to whoever has the most [poison](doc:poison).
