## Puppets

Puppets are created from real historical games played by humans. If a lobby for this game is created, and it does not get filled with people, the additional slots are filled with puppets from battlers with a similar ELO to this one.

When you play against a puppet in the [battle](doc:battle) phase, you will play against exactly what was submitted at the same time in the historical game, except their hand will be revealed. You can drag and drop and manipulate their cards just like you would be able to manipulate yours. You are supposed to figure out who would have won the game if both players were to play it out (and you didn't have access to the hidden information of course).

The point of puppets are to let you goldfish a realistic game without needing other people to play with.

## The Ghost

There always must be an even number of players in order to avoid giving any player a bye. Because of this, if a player is eliminated, and this would leave an odd number of players alive, that players last submitted build becomes "The Ghost".

"The Ghost" is played exactly like a Puppet. It's hand is revealed, and the player fighting "The Ghost" needs to determine if their build would win or lose.
