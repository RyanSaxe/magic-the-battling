## Treasures

Treasure Tokens are the unit of economy in the game. You can spend one treasure in the [draft phase](doc:draft) to see a new pack. They also start on the battlefield in the [battle phase](doc:draft), so you can use them in a game of magic to try and win.

## Poison

Whenever you lose a [battle](doc:battle), you will get some poison counters. Once you get 10 poison counters, just like in Magic, you lose the game.

Additionally, the player with the most poison gets their choice play or draw during the [battle phase](doc:battle).

## Upgrades

If you're playing with upgrades, after every third [battle](doc:battle) you will have the option of selecting an upgrade in the following [reward phase](doc:reward). Upgrades are Conspiracies with the mechanic "hidden agenda".

During the [build phase](doc:build), you can apply the upgrade to any card in your pool. This action cannot be undone. Basically, once you name a card with the hidden agenda mechanic, you are not allowed to change it for the rest of the game.
