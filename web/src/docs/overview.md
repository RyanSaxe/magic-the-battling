## Overview

> Magic: the Battling is a Magic: the Gathering format inspired by the autobattler game genre.

The way the format works, like an autobattler, is players alternate between [drafting](doc:draft) cards and playing a short game of magic (called a [battle](doc:battle)). After each [battle](doc:battle), the loser gets [poison](doc:poison) counter(s). Then all players [draft](doc:draft) again. This loop continues until only one player remains as the winner.

The set of cards you draft from is called a "battler". [Click here to view the cards in the battler you are currently playing](docs:__cards__).

## Vision

While this is an online game, the most important aspect of the design is that it can be played in person with your own curated collection of Magic cards. This should be a game that you could play for cube night, just like a novelty cube.

It was designed with the following constraints:

1. The entire game should be able to be completed in person in under 90 minutes with players familiar with the game. Games online are much quicker thanks to the logistics being entirely automated.
2. It should be able to be played in paper with a curated collection of Magic cards that people can create like a cube.
3. The focal point of the game is drafting / deckbuilding over playing, but something that is as simple as possible to explain to magic players (like play a game with a small hand) should be used to determine winning.
4. The game should mechanically resemble the autobattler game genre (e.g. have an economy that can be spent to "roll" during the draft).
5. All game pieces **must** be Magic cards, tokens, etc.

For a one pager on playing in paper, please view [the primer on CubeCobra](https://cubecobra.com/cube/about/auto?view=primer). The guide here are tailored to the online game, and hence does not include details like how to roll a die for the pairing algorithm.

## Future

If this game becomes popular, the format can evolve to have new mechanics and ways to play. The two ways I expect it to evolve in terms of new game modes are:

1. At the beginning of the game, each player is given 3 Vanguards to choose from. This is very reminiscient of concepts like the "Hero" from Hearthstone Battlegrounds.
2. Instead of all players drafting from the same battler, this format can be adapted to be played like constructed: each player comes with a 100-card singleton deck as their battler. The format would need an aggressive ban list, since certain mechanics (e.g. poison, toxic, proliferate) are incredibly problematic per the rules of the format.
