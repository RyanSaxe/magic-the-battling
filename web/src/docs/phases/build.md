## Overview

The build phase is where you decide the best starting hand you can build from your pool, which you will use in the next [battle phase](doc:battle). Remember, your basic lands and treasures start untapped on the battlefield.

> [!HINT]
> Look at the "Opponents" sidebar tab. This will show you not just which your next opponent might be, but their most recently revealed cards, their [upgrades](doc:upgrades), and the probability of facing them!

## Rules

- Click a card in your hand and pool to swap them.
- Select exactly 3 basic lands to start on the battlefield untapped.
- Your hand size is always equal to your stage.
- Click ready when satisfied with your hand configuration.
- Your opponent will be randomly chosed from three other players at your table. If you faced one of them in the previous battle, your odds of facing versus that player is only 10%.

## Controls

- Click a card in your hand and pool to swap them
- Click a basic land in order to change it
- Once you are ready, click submit in the bottom right. Then, you must select whether your hand would prefer to play or draw.
- If you have any [upgrades](doc:upgrades) you want to apply.
