## Overview

The battle phase is where you play a quick mini-game of magic with a few modified rules.

:::tip
Be very mindful of when to use [treasures](doc:treasures) to try and win a game. Remember these are the economic unit of the game, and spending them wisely is what separates good and great players! Especially because, for the final battle, having the most treasures can be a huge advantage that opens doors for drastically different hands.

## Rules

### Magic Rule Modifications

- Each player starts with 10 life
- There is no library - hence you cannot draw cards and can't lose the game due to not being able to draw cards.
- Conceding is not allowed because Treasure tokens created during a battle persist afterwards.
- A draw is considered a loss for both players.

### Before the Battle Starts

- All basic lands selected during the build phase start on the battlefield untapped.
- All [treasures](doc:treasures) a player has at the beginning of the battle phase will start on their battlefield.
- All [poison counters](doc:poison) a player has is attached to them during the battle.
- The player with the most [poison counters](doc:poison) gets their choice of play/draw. If players are tied, the choosing player is selected randomly.
- Each player's starting hand and sideboard become exactly what was selected during the build phase.

### After the Battle Ends

- The losing player(s) get N [poison counters](doc:poison), where N is 1 + the number of [upgrades](doc:upgrades) their opponent has applied. If you are not playing with upgrades, N is Fibonacci(stage - 2).
- Each player keeps up to 5 [treasures](doc:treasures) that are still on their battlefield and discards the rest.

## Controls

- You can drag and drop cards between any zones, including your opponent's zones in order to make casting cards like Reanimate easier to resolve.

  - If a card is selected, some extra actions will appear.
  - Right clicking on a card will also bring up the action options for that card.
- Click "submit" on the bottom right when you know the result of the game to move onto the next phase.
