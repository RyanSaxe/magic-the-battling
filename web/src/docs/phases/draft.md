## Overview

The draft phase is where you have the opportunity to make significant changes to your pool of cards.

:::tip
Look at the numbers in the top left of the screen (3-1 at game start). This is the current stage-round. The "stage" is what your hand size will be in the next [battle phase](doc:battle). Each stage has three "rounds" that go through the draft -> build -> battle -> reward loop. The [reward phase](doc:reward) for that last round increases your hand size for the next stage.

## Rules

- You are dealt a pack of 5 cards to draft from.
- You can swap any card from your pool with any card in the pack. You can take this action any number of times.
- Spend 1 treasure to reroll the pack: discard the current pack and be dealt a new one.
- At the end of the upcoming [battle phase](doc:battle) you are only allowed to keep 5 treasures. If you currently have more than 5, or are planning on playing a hand that will produce treasures over the limit, you should consider rolling.

## Controls

- Click any two cards to swap them.
- Click the roll button on the bottom left to discard this pack and see a new one.
- Click the button on the bottom right to go to the [build phase](doc:build). But be careful, as you cannot go back phases.
- If you have [upgrades](doc:game-pieces#upgrades), you can click the button on the bottom left to view them.
